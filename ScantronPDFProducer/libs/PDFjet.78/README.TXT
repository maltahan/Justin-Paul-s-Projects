Thank you for evaluating the Open Source version of PDFjet v2.78.

To rebuild the PDFjet.jar, PDFjet.dll and the examples please run the following commands in the exact same sequence:


jc.cmd
nc.cmd
generate-documentation.cmd


For everything to work properly you will need to have installed both Java v1.5 or higher AND .NET SDK v2.0 or higher.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions please e-mail us at:
